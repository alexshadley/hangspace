# Hangspace!

A place for us to hang out :)

## Setup

1. Use this in a codespace!! You can click the green `<> Code` dropdown and create a codespace from there. It's going to build postgres from source (idk why) so it might take like ~5min to set up.
2. Once the codespace is ready, run `yarn init-db` to set up the database. It'll make a `users` and a `posts` table and add some test data. You can run this as many times as you want, it just blows away the old schema and makes a new one.
3. That's it! You should be done and ready to develop.

## TODO

Some features we need to build

- Writing new posts
- User logins
- More appealing UI
- Image posts
- MORE???
